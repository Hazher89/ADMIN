# GDPR Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This application is designed to be fully GDPR compliant with complete data isolation between companies.

## Data Isolation Principles

### 1. Company-Based Data Segregation
- **All data queries are filtered by `companyId`**
- **No cross-company data access is possible**
- **Each company can only see their own data**

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Users are authenticated via Firebase Auth
- Each user has a `companyId` in their profile
- All data access is restricted to the user's company

### 3. Database Security Rules
- Firestore security rules enforce company-based access
- Users can only read/write data for their own company
- No data can be accessed across company boundaries

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Security
```typescript
// All pages check for companyId before loading data
if (!userProfile?.companyId) {
  console.log('No company ID found, cannot load data');
  return;
}

// All Firebase queries include companyId filter
const data = await firebaseService.getEmployees(userProfile.companyId);
```

### Backend Security
```typescript
// All Firebase service methods require companyId
async getEmployees(companyId: string): Promise<Employee[]> {
  const q = query(
    collection(db, 'users'),
    where('companyId', '==', companyId)
  );
  // ...
}
```

### Data Models
All data models include `companyId` field:
```typescript
interface Employee {
  id: string;
  companyId: string; // Required for GDPR compliance
  // ... other fields
}
```

## GDPR Requirements Met

### ✅ Data Minimization
- Only necessary data is collected
- Data is not shared between companies

### ✅ Purpose Limitation
- Data is only used for the intended business purpose
- No cross-company data processing

### ✅ Storage Limitation
- Data is retained only as long as necessary
- Deletion mechanisms are in place

### ✅ Integrity and Confidentiality
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access is restricted to authorized users only

### ✅ Accountability
- All data access is logged
- Audit trails are maintained

## Security Measures

### 1. Query Filtering
- All database queries include `companyId` filter
- No queries can return data from other companies

### 2. Authentication
- Firebase Auth ensures user identity
- Company association is verified on every request

### 3. Authorization
- Role-based access control within companies
- Admin functions restricted to appropriate users

### 4. Data Encryption
- Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Data encrypted at rest (Firebase)

## Monitoring & Auditing

### Access Logs
- All data access is logged
- Unusual access patterns are monitored

### Error Handling
- Failed authentication attempts are logged
- Data access errors are tracked

## Data Deletion

### User Deletion
- When a user is deleted, their data is removed
- Associated records are cleaned up

### Company Deletion
- When a company is deleted, all associated data is removed
- No orphaned data remains

## Compliance Verification

### Regular Audits
- Code reviews ensure GDPR compliance
- Security testing validates data isolation

### Testing
- Automated tests verify data isolation
- Manual testing confirms no cross-company access
